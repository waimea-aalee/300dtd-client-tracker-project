# Sprint 1 - A Working UI Prototype


## Sprint Goals

Develop a prototype that simulates the key functionality of the system, then test and refine it so that it can serve as the model for the next phase of development in Sprint 2.

[Figma](https://www.figma.com/) is used to develop the prototype.

## Initial Database Design

This is the initial design for the database, there's 3 linked tables; users so people can login, which have multiple clients, then the jobs for that specific client with different data for the clients and jobs.

### Required Data Input

The end user will input data about the clients and the jobs that are in progress once they have created an account and logged in. There is a checkbox to tick whether the client has been billed for a job and if it has been paid for.

### Required Data Output

The system will output data

Replace this text with a description of the outputs for the system - what types of data will be displayed?

### Required Data Processing

Replace this text with a description of how the data will be processed to achieve the desired output(s) - any processes / formulae?

## UI 'Flow'

The first stage of prototyping was to explore how the UI might 'flow' between states, based on the required functionality.

This Figma demo shows the initial design for the UI 'flow':

**FIGMA FLOW - PLACE THE FIGMA EMBED CODE HERE - MAKE SURE IT IS SET SO THAT EVERYONE CAN ACCESS IT**

### Testing

Replace this text with notes about what you did to test the UI flow and the outcome of the testing.

### Changes / Improvements

Replace this text with notes any improvements you made as a result of the testing.

## Initial UI Prototype

The next stage of prototyping was to develop the layout for each screen of the UI.

This Figma demo shows the initial layout design for the UI:

### Testing

Replace this text with notes about what you did to test the UI flow and the outcome of the testing.

### Changes / Improvements

Replace this text with notes any improvements you made as a result of the testing.

## Refined UI Prototype

Having established the layout of the UI screens, the prototype was refined visually, in terms of colour, fonts, etc.

This Figma demo shows the UI with refinements applied:

*FIGMA REFINED PROTOTYPE - PLACE THE FIGMA EMBED CODE HERE - MAKE SURE IT IS SET SO THAT EVERYONE CAN ACCESS IT*

### Testing

Replace this text with notes about what you did to test the UI flow and the outcome of the testing.

### Changes / Improvements

Replace this text with notes any improvements you made as a result of the testing.

## Sprint Review

Replace this text with a statement about how the sprint has moved the project forward - key success point, any things that didn't go so well, etc.
