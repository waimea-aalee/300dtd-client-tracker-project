# Project Requirements

## Identified Problem or Need

My step dad has a problem I will attempt to solve. He is a builder and he has struggle with keeping track of the jobs he's done for clients to help with billinig the correct people the correct amount.

## End-User Requirements

My step dad is my end-user and I will be talking to during the project. He would need a large font that's easy to read and a simple to use/straight forward layout.

## Proposed Solution

I intend to create an app that allows my end-user to manage clients and jobs efficiently. The system will let the user: add, edit, and delete clients and jobs; mark jobs as billed or paid using checkboxes; view client and job details in a clear and simple layout; and have secure log in to ensure only their data is accessible. The key functionality focuses on making it easy to track work done, manage billing, and maintain client records.

# Relevant Implications

## Functionality

The functionality implication means that everything in the website, and it works well. It should be meeting its purpose and works as expected. It should be meeting all the end user's requirements be able to deal with all types of inputs

### Relevance to the System

This implication is relevant to my project because everything should be functioning well and needs to work as expected.

### Impact / Considerations

I will need to consider that everything is working, the project is heavily impacted by this implication because if it is not functioning then no one can use it.


## Usability

The usability implication is how easy the website is to use without any help or guidance. Things should be able to get done quickly and easily. The layout should feel familiar. There should always be a clear way for the end user to move forwards or cancel an action if needed. And it should be clear  and obvious what is happening to the end user at all times.

### Relevance to the System

This implication is relevant to my project because the website I am creating should be easy to use, especially for my end user who needs something straight forward.

### Impact / Considerations

I will need to consider who this is made for so it's easy for the end user to work out. The project will be impacted by this implication because if it is confusing to use it would be frustrating to the end user and they would not want to use it.


## Aesthetics

The aesthetic implication is about how the website looks. It should be appealing to the end user and follow design conventions. There should also be a good use of the fonts, like the colour and position. The design should be relevant to what's made (e.g if it's a site on bikes there may be a picture of one instead of a cat.) Colours should work together to create a pleasing effect. Certain elements should be grouped or seperated depending on whether they should be linked or not.

### Relevance to the System

This implication is relevant to my project because the aesthetics of the website should be appealing and the elements should be grouped correctly to make it less confusing for the end user.

### Impact / Considerations

I will need to think about correctly grouping elements and making the site look appealing to the end user. This impacts it by making a layout less confusing for an end user so they will like it and if it's appealing they'll enjoy using it.


## End-user

This implication is connected to the specific needs of the end user(s). The needs could be about age, education, interests, etc. It should be appealing to the correct  people.

### Relevance to the System

This implication is relevant to this project because I am targeting specific users, in this case for builders so I need to know about my end users specific needs.

### Impact / Considerations

I will need to consider getting regular feedback from my end user, this implication impacts the project because if I didn't get feedback about what the end user wants, they most likely will not use it as it doesn't fit their needs.


## Privacy

Privacy implications is about protecting the end users data and privacy and making sure it stays private

### Relevance to the System

This is relevant to my project because it has information about clients such as address and phonenumber which shouldn't be accessed by the public and only by the end user who did the inputs

### Impact / Considerations

Moving forward I will need to consider keeping information protected and private so nothing is accessed by the incorrect people

# User Experience (UX) Principles

## Useful

The system should be useful, and it should fulfill a real need for a group of end users

### Relevance to the System

This principle is relevant to this project because if it is not useful or not fulfilling a need, it will not be used and have no purpose making it useless

### Impact / Considerations

Moving forward I will need to consider the need of the end user, the usefulness impacts the project because if it is not useful or not a real need nobody will have a need  for it and it will not be used



## Findable

The system should be easy to navigate so the end user can find the content or function they need to with no problem

### Relevance to the System

This principle is relevant to this project because it should be easy to navigate especially for my end user who is not very familiar with technology.

### Impact / Considerations

I will need to consider how easy everything is to use/find so it is easy for my end user. If it's difficult it will impact the end user they may get frustrated and get fed up by the site


## Usable

The system should be easy to  use for the intended end user, however, good usability on its own is not sufficient

### Relevance to the System

This principle is relevant to my project because it should be easy to use, if it is confusing it will be frustrating to my end user or anyone using the site

### Impact / Considerations

I will need to consider while moving forward how easy this is to use, the placement of buttons and any icons looking familiar (e.g a house for home button)
