# Project Review

## Addressing Relevant Implications

### Functionality

I tested my app after adding every new feature to make sure everything is working correctly. This was stuff such as checking jobs and client info can be added, edited and deleted etc.


### Usability

I have made sure the app is simple and easy to use for my end user. The buttons are obvious and clear so it's easy to know what they do, I also tested every link and button to make sure everything goes to the right place


### Aesthetics

I tried to make the layout the least confusing as possible by grouping certain elements together and keeping the pages consistent, minimal and easy to look at


### End-user

I designed the app with my end user in mind, which is specifically for a builder. I made sure it's easy to use for them and has the necessary features, such as the clients, jobs and whether it's been billed and paid for


### Privacy

I made sure all the client information such as addresses and phone numbers remain private by only letting logged in users view and edit their own data to ensure privacy

## Overall Review

Replace these words with a brief review of how the project went in terms of:
- What went well?
- What didn't go so well?
- How did the testing/trialling impact the final system?
- What would you do differently if you could?

Overall I think the project went well. All the features I added work how I intended to and the data displays correctly. Testing each feature as  I added them helped fixed the problems quickly and easier. Something that didn't go so well was getting some of the routes to work at first, I needed to do a lot of testing to figure out the problems which helped me understand SQL a bit better. Trialling and testing had significant difference because I could see what needed to be improved and tweaked. Something I'd do differently if I could, I'd spend more time on the layout and design and maybe add extra feature like sorting client names to make them easier to find.
