# Project Review

## Addressing Relevant Implications

### Functionality

I tested my app after adding every new feature to make sure everything is working correctly. This was stuff such as checking jobs and client info can be added, edited and deleted etc.


### Usability

I have made sure the app is simple and easy to use for my end user. The buttons are obvious and clear so it's easy to know what they do, I also tested every link and button to make sure everything goes to the right place


### Aesthetics

I tried to make the layout the least confusing as possible by grouping certain elements together and keeping the pages consistent, minimal and easy to look at


### End-user

I designed the app with my end user in mind, which is specifically for a builder. I made sure it's easy to use for them and has the necessary features, such as the clients, jobs and whether it's been billed and paid for


### Privacy

I made sure all the client information such as addresses and phone numbers remain private
